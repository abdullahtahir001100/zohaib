                    <p>
                        The Azimuth Masterpiece Set is the result of over two decades of refinement by Master Penman,
                        **Akiro Sato**. Every element of this set has been optimized for superior performance and
                        longevity. The rosewood used for the pen holder is ethically sourced and cured for three years
                        before being hand-turned and polished to a satin finish. This careful process ensures a perfect
                        balance point, reducing hand fatigue during long writing sessions. The natural grain of the wood
                        makes every holder unique, truly turning a tool into an individual work of art.

                    <h3>Akiro Sato: The Quiet Master of Kyoto</h3>
                    <p>
                        Akiro Sato began his apprenticeship at the age of ten, not with a pen, but with the meticulous
                        restoration of ancient scrolls. This early exposure to the historical preservation of art
                        instilled in him a profound respect for materials and craftsmanship. He spent years
                        experimenting with traditional ink recipes, eventually developing the archival mineral inks
                        included in this set—pigments that promise to hold their depth and luster for centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His workshop, nestled in the historic Higashiyama district of Kyoto, is less a factory and more
                        a sanctuary. He believes that the energy and intention put into creating a tool transfer to the
                        user's work. This Masterpiece Set is his first widely available collection, representing a
                        distillation of everything he has learned about balance, feel, and timeless elegance. Purchasing
                        this set is not just buying a tool; it is acquiring a piece of Sato's dedication to the craft.

                    <h4>Care Instructions:</h4>
                    <p>
                        To maintain the integrity of your rosewood pen holder, avoid prolonged exposure to direct
                        sunlight and extreme humidity. After use, wipe the holder clean with a soft, dry cloth. Nibs
                        should be rinsed immediately with clean water and thoroughly dried to prevent corrosion. Never
                        leave the nib soaking in water.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Our Lifetime Guarantee:</h4>
                    <p>
